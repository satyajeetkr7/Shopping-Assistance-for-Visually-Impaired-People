# Shopping-Assistance-for-Visually-Impaired-People
Recognition of grocery products in store shelves poses peculiar challenges. Firstly, the task mandates the recognition of an extremely high number of different items, in the order of several thousand for medium-small shops, with many of them featuring small inter and intra class variability. Then, available product databases usually include just one or a few studio-quality images per product (referred to herein as reference images), whilst at test time recognition is performed on pictures displaying a portion of a shelf containing several products and taken in the store by cheap cameras (referred to as query images). Moreover, as the items on sale in a store as well as their appearance change frequently over time, a practical recognition system should handle seamlessly new products/packages. Inspired by recent advances in object detection and image retrieval, we propose to leverage on state-of-the-art image classification based on deep learning. In the study conducted our objective is to use this technology to help blind people around the world, which will help them to shop easily to identity the grocery product on the shelves. For image classification various CNN based image classification algorithms have been applied in this study. Our system is computationally expensive at training time but can perform recognition rapidly and accurately at test time.
